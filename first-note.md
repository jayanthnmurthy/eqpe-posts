## About
This is a sample note offering the simplicity of markdown.

### Let's get started
Jot your thoughts with a new note;  
* add two spaces, followed by the 'enter/return key' to create a new-line within the same paragraph.
* two return keys after a line produces a new para.

## Adding images
Images can be added like so - 
<img    src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png"    width="100px" height="100px"/> 
Neat isn't it?

```
tags are added using a pair of back-ticks,
